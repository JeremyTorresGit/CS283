1. How does the remote client determine when a command's output is fully received from the server, and what techniques can be used to handle partial reads or ensure complete message transmission?

The remote client detemines that a command's output is fully received when it detects the server's termination marker (which is the EOF in the assignement). The client continuously reads from the socket in a loop until it encounters EOF. To handle partial reads or ensure complete message transmission, the client can check return values from recv() or use a buffer to store data and process it incrementally.

2. This week's lecture on TCP explains that it is a reliable stream protocol rather than a message-oriented one. Since TCP does not preserve message boundaries, how should a networked shell protocol define and detect the beginning and end of a command sent over a TCP connection? What challenges arise if this is not handled correctly?

The protocol must define a delimiter or length-prefixed format to indicate message boundaries. In the remote shell implementation, commands are terminated with `\0` and responses are terminated with `0x04`. The markers must be interpreted by the client and server to reconstruct full messages. If not handled correctly, a message can be split across many packets or the receiver may waits indefinitely for more data.

3. Describe the general differences between stateful and stateless protocols.

Stateful protocols track session details across many requests since they keep information between client and server interactions in the past. On the other hand, stateless protocols don't keep past interactions in their memory with each request is independently treated. 

4. Our lecture this week stated that UDP is "unreliable". If that is the case, why would we ever use it?

UDP is a message oriented protocol where individual messages are packaged and delivered. UDP is not 100% reliable. Although, UDP can be useful when low latency and fast transmission is wanted over reliability. Softwares happening in real-time, such as online gaming, could favor fast packet retransmition and want to utilize UDP.  

5. What interface/abstraction is provided by the operating system to enable applications to use network communications?

The operating system provide sockets. In the assignment, we manipulate the connections by using functions like socket(), bind(), recv(), send(), and close(). The operating system communicates over networks through an interface, allowing me to create the client-server model. In this assignment, I was able to guarantee data was sent and received correctly when using TCP sockets.
